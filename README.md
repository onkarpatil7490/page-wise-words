## API Setup (Optional)

### For Context Analysis
The AI-powered context feature uses the **Gemini API**. This is optional; dictionary meanings work without it.

1. Visit [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Create an account and generate an API key
3. Enter the API key in the app when prompted

> **Note:** Only context analysis uses the internet. All PDFs and vocabulary data are processed locally.
